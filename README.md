Inspiration:
The inspiration for The Animated Oat Optimization Algorithm (AOO) is derived from the unique propagation mechanism of the seeds of Animated Oat. In the natural environment, when the seeds of Animated Oat detach from the parent plant, they display special movement modes such as tumbling and leaping. This unique movement enables the seeds to spread over longer distances in a shorter period of time, thus realizing more efficient dissemination. The algorithm emulates the tumbling and bouncing behaviors of the seeds to integrate local search with global search, thereby attaining more efficient optimization performance.
 

Mechanisms:
AOO simulates 3 unique behaviors of Animated Oat: (i) seed dispersal through natural elements such as wind, water, and animals; (ii) under the influence of hygroscopic movement, the primary awn of Animated Oat seeds undergoes distortion and rotation, enabling the entire seed to roll and propagate; and (iii) during the rolling propagation, energy is stored upon encountering obstacles, triggering a propulsion mechanism under certain conditions to further disperse the seeds.
